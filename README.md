# STM32-MPU6050-OOP-Driver
This repository contains an object-oriented C++ driver for the MPU6050 sensor, designed to run on STM32 microcontrollers. The driver allows for easy interfacing with the MPU6050 to read accelerometer and gyroscope data, calculate angles, and retrieve temperature readings.
